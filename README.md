WAR

This project is a Spring Hibernate web app implementation of the simple card game War.
It will only be playable by one person. The player will have 3 options: draw, automatic, or go back. Draw is a button that will play one turn of the card game. Automatic will run all turns and resolve the game immediately. Go back is to quit. 
After a game is finished there will be a history slider, where the player can go back and forward in time to see each turn of the game that just ended.
